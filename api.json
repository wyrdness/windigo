      "full": "The Windigo (Ojibwe variant of Wendigo) is a sacred spiritual being in Ojibwe/Anishinaabe traditions representing cannibalistic spirit with ice and winter associations, symbolized by a heart of ice. Like the Cree Wendigo, it represents the spiritual and moral transformation that occurs when humans resort to cannibalism or are consumed by greed. This is a profound cultural teaching about survival ethics in harsh conditions, the absolute prohibition against cannibalism, and the importance of community interdependence over individual survival. Humans who became Windigo were traditionally subject to execution by the community. The concept has been severely appropriated by horror genre, causing harm by disconnecting it from sacred meaning. This is not entertainment but living sacred teaching being actively reclaimed by Ojibwe communities. Understanding requires centering Ojibwe and Anishinaabe voices and approaching with deep respect for sacred knowledge."
