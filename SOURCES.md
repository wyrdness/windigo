## Ojibwe Language Note

Understanding that "Windigo" reflects Ojibwe language helps understand cultural specificity:
- Windigo/Wiindigo = Ojibwe spelling
- Wendigo/Wetiko = Cree spelling
- Both represent sacred teachings from related but distinct nations
- Both deserve equal respect

## A Final Note

The best sources on Windigo are **Ojibwe and Anishinaabe knowledge keepers and communities themselves**.

This bibliography can only point toward published scholarship. True understanding requires:
- Listening to Indigenous voices
- Respecting sacred knowledge
- Recognizing your own limitations as outsider
- Approaching with humility and respect
- Supporting Indigenous communities and scholars

**If you are not from these communities, your role is to listen and learn, not to interpret or appropriate.**

**Support Indigenous scholars by buying their books, attending their talks, and amplifying their voices.**
