## Overview

The Windigo (Ojibwe: Wiindigo, also Witiko) is a sacred spiritual being in Ojibwe and Anishinaabe traditions representing a cannibalistic spirit associated with ice, winter, and a heart turned to ice.

Like the Cree Wendigo (language variant), the Windigo embodies the spiritual and moral transformation that occurs when humans resort to cannibalism or are consumed by greed that overrides community values.

**This is not a monster story.** It is a profound spiritual teaching about:
- Survival ethics in extreme conditions
- The absolute taboo against cannibalism
- Community interdependence over individual survival
- The loss of humanity through violation of core values
- The spiritual death that comes from severing community bonds

---

## Sacred Teaching Context

### Purpose

The Windigo teaching developed in context of:
- Harsh winter survival conditions
- Resource scarcity and periodic starvation
- Absolute dependence on community cooperation
- Need to maintain sharing and collective values
- Ultimate prohibition against cannibalism

### Core Lessons

1. **Cannibalism = Spiritual Death**: Eating human flesh means complete loss of humanity
2. **Community Interdependence**: Survival depends on cooperation and sharing
3. **Individual vs. Collective**: Must choose community over personal survival
4. **Greed Destroys**: Selfishness corrupts person and harms community
5. **Maintaining Humanity**: Requires maintaining community bonds and values

### Spiritual Meaning

**Transformation**: Humans who commit cannibalism become Windigo - they are no longer human but spiritually corrupted beings.

**Heart of Ice**: The Windigo has a frozen heart, symbolizing the loss of human warmth, compassion, and connection to community.

**Insatiable Hunger**: Can never be satisfied, representing the destructive endlessness of greed and selfishness.
